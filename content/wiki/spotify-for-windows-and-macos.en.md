This is the default API for Windows and Mac OS users. You don't have to install anything, since it's already installed by default on these platforms.

### Current limitations
* The [library used](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwSpotify) to access information from the Spotify API is unable to obtain its position.
* Mac OS usage hasn't been tested because their emulators are really limited. If you're having issues, please open an [issue](https://github.com/vidify/vidify) with detailed information.
