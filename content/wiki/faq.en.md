### My favorite music player isn't supported by Vidify
Vidify was created with this in mind. There are many different music players and we are working on supporting as many of them as possible. Please do [let us know](https://github.com/vidify/vidify/issues/new) so that we know what players are more popular.

### Vidify doesn't recognize some downloaded songs
If the song doesn't have a metadata field with its title and artist (the latter is optional), Vidify is unable to know what song is playing. Try to modify the metadata of your downloaded songs with VLC or any other tool.
