I have created a Discord server for Vidify! You can join [using this link](https://discord.gg/yfJSyPv). It's meant for quick conversations outside of GitHub, for both depelopment and user reasons.

I was initially going to use an open source alternative but decided to go for Discord because it's the easiest. If you'd like to suggest any other platform please let me know.

If you have experience with Discord servers I'd love to get some help as well, as I haven't managed one before :)

如果你对 Discord 服务器有经验的话，我也想得到一些帮助，因为我以前没有管理过:）
