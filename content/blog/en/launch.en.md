I'm officially releasing Vidify's website!

This site is intended for non-developers, I'll migrate part of the [GitHub](https://github.com/vidify/vidify) documentation here on how to use Vidify. The wiki is also better managed in here because multiple languages can be used easily, and anyone can still contribute by making a PR to [vidify/vidify.org-source](https://github.com/vidify/vidify.org-source), which is better than wiki contributions.

I still have to polish it a lot, but it's ready to be public already. If you find any issues please let me know in an issue.
